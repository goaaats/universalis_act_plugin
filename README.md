# universalis_act_plugin
ACT plugin to upload market board data to [Universalis](https://universalis.app).

## Standalone uploader
The Releases tab also includes a zip of our standalone uploader, which works without ACT. Please remember to add a firewall exception before running it, or it will not work. If you are running it in RawSocket mode, you will also need to run it with admin privileges.

If you start it after you log in, be sure to change zones once so the plugin can track your uploads.
